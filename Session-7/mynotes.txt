CLIENT-SERVER MODEL

The client starts the communication with the server by means of a computer (mobile phone, tablet...). You can have two different programs
working on the same computer.

There isn't any wire or direct connection between the client and the server, because they are connected to a network, Internet, allowing
both programs to communicate with each other.

Inside Internet, there are many interconnected computers, and divided in groups called networks. to send a message from a client
to a server, we need to identify both participants thanks to an IP address, which refers to the network interphase of the computers.
 Client and server can be in different networks.

The IP address of the computer in the lab is 212.128.253.66

* ping time to my mobile phone: 323 ms

commands used:
    ifconfig

URL (Uniform Resource Locator) - for identifying a computer interphase for humans

There are special servers in Internet (DNS) that translate the IP addresses to URL. A browser takes that IP address and connects to the
machine.

* Ping to Google: 216.58.211.228
